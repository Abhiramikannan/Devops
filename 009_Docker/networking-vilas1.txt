Docker networking:
        ip address: unique routable address given to a device on a network follows ip protocol
                    network have CIDR
        Ethernet card: wired cable connected to a socket..
        Ethernet cable:wired cable
        network switch: broadcast the ip with in the network
            arp caching:cach the data by saying the ip address is related to that mac address

            arp->broadcast ip sents the msg... using handshake signal
                cach the mac address at the last

        Nating/Denating:
            gateway:connect 2 diff type of network
            nating:from adrress is changed to that of gateway(priv ip to public)

        subnet and subnetting: first 2 ip is reserved for network and broadcast
                 
when u install docker:
    Docker 0:
        root nic in vm = Eth 0
        Ip table: make entry
                rule:any communication happens that need to sents to docker 0
Default ip range of docker 0:
            172.17.0.1 -172.17.255.255
        CIDR: 172.17.0.0/16

        veth:virutal ethernet card
         create a container also have Eth 0
            by default the container is connected to default bridge network ie,docker 0
            docker 0 is connected to container using  veth
if u have another container, automatically connected to docker 0 using veth
  docker 0 acts as switch,gateway -> broadcast the msg to all containers
the msg will come to eth 0 in vm (default root)
switch have default root

network switch be down until a container connected to it

for container,gateway is docker 0
inside container: loopback and eth 0 can see
create bridge network: docker network create name
                created a network named my bridge,actually a switch
                so the docker 0 containers and mybridge containers are not connected,they cant communicate
docker run -d --net mybridge nginx=connecting to the network

host network
create container attcah to host network,
    automatically connected to host  machines network,
    no port forwarding req

docker run -d --net host nginx=:not listening to port 80
                                no ip address
                    again try to create another container with same name, it will not work
                    cant see the container in docker ps,you can see container got exited 
                    because the port is already in use,network range also already in use
                    so it will not work


null: when u create  container and attach to none network
    no ip
    no network
    y: to provide your own network 



docker network connect mybridge alpine2
when a container is running ,no ip is assigned to othr containers

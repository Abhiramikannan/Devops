What is Bridge in Docker? (Simple Explanation)
A bridge in Docker is the default network that allows containers to communicate with each other on the same host while keeping them isolated from external networks.

How Bridge Network Works?
When you run a container, Docker automatically assigns it to the default bridge network (bridge).
Containers in the same bridge network can communicate using their names.
By default, containers cannot access each other unless you explicitly connect them.
How to Use Bridge Network?
1. Check Available Networks

docker network ls
Shows the default bridge network and any custom networks.
2. Create a Custom Bridge Network

docker network create my_bridge
Creates a new isolated bridge network.
3. Run a Container in the Custom Bridge Network

docker run -d --name my_container --network my_bridge nginx
The container joins my_bridge instead of the default bridge.
4. Connect Two Containers

docker run -d --name app --network my_bridge ubuntu
docker run -d --name db --network my_bridge mysql
app and db can now talk to each other using their container names.
5. Inspect a Network

docker network inspect my_bridge
Shows details like connected containers and IP addresses.
6. Remove a Network

docker network rm my_bridge
Deletes the network (containers must be stopped first).
Key Takeaways
The bridge network is the default Docker network.
Containers in the same bridge can communicate using names.
Use custom bridge networks for better isolation and control.
By default, bridge does not allow external access (use -p for port mapping).

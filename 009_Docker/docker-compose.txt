1. docker compose : 
docker compose is used to refer to a Compose file that defines multiple containers, networks,
and volumes in one place.
 manage multiple containers together
        feature
        multi container u can do
        refer docker file execute 1 command..building image from docker file ,
        docker compose file: also mention image
                dwld image and create a container

            when u create a container from doker compose,default create bridge network
                attach all containers created with that network
                mention multiple containers(services)

    cd dockerk8s
    ls
    cat dc1.yml
          sevices: 

file name: docker compose.yml ->dont give file name
                otherwise -f

docker compose -f dc1.yaml up -dc1
-f dc1.yaml: Specifies the Compose file to use.
-d: Runs the containers in detached mode (background).

   not create new network for other one:
           The issue occurs because Docker Compose reuses networks instead of creating a new one
            if:

            No network is explicitly defined in dc1.yaml.
            A named network in dc1.yaml already exists.

When you run:

docker compose -f dc1.yaml up -d

What Happens Internally?
Reads dc1.yaml → Docker Compose loads the configuration (services, networks, volumes).
Creates Network (if not already exists) → Uses a bridge network by default.
Creates Volumes (if defined) → Ensures persistent storage.
Pulls Images (if not available locally) → Downloads from Docker Hub or private registry.
Creates & Starts Containers → Launches services in detached mode (-d).
Sets Up Dependencies → Ensures services start in the correct order.
Simple Example Flow:
You define two services (app & db) in dc1.yaml.
Running docker compose up -d:
Creates a shared network → dc1_default.
Pulls app and db images.
Starts both containers inside the network.


docker network ls
curl localhost:8080
docker ps :can see docker-k8s-web
       folder name service name

automatically dwld and create a container
build- locn of dockrfile
        name of image

docker compose -f dc2.yml up -d 
up: run and build
compose:refer compose file like docker network
curl localhost:8080



build->point to docker file  ./



cloning voting app.git
cd example voting app/vote
cat Dockerfile

requirements.txt: Dependencies

as base: initial part of image
base layer
install curl
set wd of image
copy req.txt to wd
running pakage installer
created a new storage
using prvous base image
flask env
command run whn
expose 80
starting the execution using gunicorn
0.0.0.0 :bind into local host

cd ..
ls
cat docker-compose.yml


   
result : another service
build : locn of docker file 
cd result
cat Dockerfile 

copy:do only not changin so often

    cd worker
    cat Dockerfile

how to create windows image on linux?
    run base image of windows
why windows: some application need to deploy on windows.

arg : like variables
csproj: artifact
only copy from applicn


seed:if data is present we can understand its working
docker compose --profile seed up -d
What It Does:
docker compose → Runs Docker Compose.
--profile seed → Activates the profile named seed in the docker-compose.yml file.
up -d → Starts the containers in detached mode (running in the background).



docker compose up -d 
       pulling ,-> dependencies
       Docker starts containers based on dependencies.
       Each container runs its ENTRYPOINT or CMD
       If health checks are defined, Docker waits until services are healthy.
docker ps
check port of voting app and result
curl localhost:8080
